Modular level generator
***********************
Now that we are aware how level generation works in general, we can have
a look at more modular approach. 
:class:`pyherc.generators.level.generator.LevelGenerator` is a high level
generator that can be used to create different kinds of levels. Usually
the system does not directly use it, but queries a fully setup generator
from :class:`pyherc.generators.level.generator.LevelGeneratorFactory`

Overview of LevelGenerator
==========================
.. code-block:: python

    def generate_level(self, portal, model, new_portals = 0, level=1, room_min_size = (2, 2)):

LevelGenerator has same generate_level - method as other level generators and
calling it functions in the same way. Difference is in the internals of the
generator. Instead of performing all the level generation by itself, 
LevelGenerator breaks it into steps and delegates each step to a sub component.

First new level is created and sent to a partitioner. This component will
divide level into sections and link them to each other randomly. Partitioners
are required to ensure that all sections are reachable.

A room is generated within each section and corridors are used to link rooms
to neighbouring sections. Linking is done according to links set up in the
previous phase. This in turn ensures that each room is reachable.

In decoration step details are added into the level. Walls are built where
empty space meets solid ground and floors are detailed.

Portals are added by portal adders. These portals will lead deeper in the dungeon
and cause new levels generated when player walks down to them. One special portal
is also created, that links generated level to the higher level.

Adding of creatures is done by creature adders. These contains information of the
type of creatures to add and their placement.

Items are added in the same way as the portals, but item adders are used.

Partitioners
============
:class:`pyherc.generators.level.partitioners.grid.GridPartitioner` is basic partitioner,
which knows how to divide level into a grid with equal sized sections.

GridPartitioner has method:

.. code-block:: python

    def partition_level(self, level,  x_sections = 3,  y_sections = 3):
    
Calling this method will partition level to sections, link sections to each other
and return them in a list.

:class:`pyherc.generators.level.partitioners.section.Section` is used to represent
section. It defines a rectangular area in level, links to neighbouring areas and
information how they should connect to each other. It also defines connections
for rooms.

Room generators
===============
Room generators are used to create rooms inside of sections created by partitioner.
Each section has information how they link together and these connection points must
be linked together by room generator.

Room generator only needs a single method:

.. code-block:: python

    def generate_room(self, section):

Calling this method should create a room inside section and connect all connection
points together.

Simple example can be found from :class:`pyherc.generators.level.room.squareroom.SquareRoomGenerator`

Decorators
==========
Decorators can be used to add theme to level. Simple ones can be used to change
appearance of the floor to something different than what was generated by room 
generator. More complex usage is to detect where walls are located and change 
their appearance.

New decorator can be created by subclassing :class:`pyherc.generators.level.decorator.basic.Decorator`
and overriding method:

.. code-block:: python

    def decorate_level(self, level):

Portal adders
=============
:class:`pyherc.generators.level.portals.PortalAdder` is responsible class for
generating portals. the class itself is pretty simple. It contains information 
of what kind of icons to use, where to place the portal (room, corridor, 
treasure chamber and so on) and what kind of level it will lead to.

Method:

.. code-block:: python

    def add_portal(self, level):

Will create a proxy portal at a random location. This portal will contain 
name of the level, instead of direct link. When player enters the portal,
a new level generator is created and used to generate the new level.
    
Creature adder
==============
Creatures are added with :class:`pyherc.generators.level.creatures.CreatureAdder`.
Usually there is no reason to subclass this class, but simple configuration is
enough.

Item adder
==========
Items  are added with :class:`pyherc.generators.level.items.ItemAdder`.
Usually there is no reason to subclass this class, but simple configuration is
enough.
