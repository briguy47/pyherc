Playing the game
================
Herculeum offers two ways of playing the game: keyboard and gamepad. Both come
with default configuration, but user can map keys and buttons the way he feels
is the most comfortable.

Moving around
-------------
Character can be moved around by cursor keys. If the character is facing to
other direction than where he is about to move, the first keypress will change
his direction and the second one will make actual move. If character is already
facing correct direction, first keypress will make him to move.
